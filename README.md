This repository demonstrates a common Java error: the ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException.  The `bug.java` file contains the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.java` provides the corrected version.  This exception occurs when you try to access an array element using an index that is either negative or greater than or equal to the array's length.  The solution involves carefully checking array bounds before accessing elements.
